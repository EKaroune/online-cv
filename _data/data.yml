        Open archaeobotanical research specialising in phytolith analysis. I am currently working on two projects: i) an open project concerning the application of               phytolith analysis on British Archaeological sites including investigations into the methodologies used in phytolith analysis to build more robust and                   reproducible methods; ii) the development of open science practices in phytolith research. The later project has focused initially on assessing the extent of             open science in this field and starting to build an open research community (see my project page: https://osf.io/qp68n/). Moving forward, I am collaborating,             with my newly formed working group, to expand and consolidate this community, and we have applied for a European Open Science Cloud Digital Life Science Grant to         fund a FAIRification project, in which I will be the Principal Investigator.
